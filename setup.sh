Thank you for reporting this and providing the context. It seems like you've run into a classic race condition, which is a common and tricky issue in automation scripts like this.

Here’s my analysis of what likely happened:

1.  Your script started both the `3x-ui` and `Caddy` containers.
2.  Caddy successfully and quickly obtained the SSL certificate.
3.  The script detected the certificate file and immediately tried to update the `3x-ui` database (`x-ui.db`).
4.  However, the `3x-ui` container, while running, might not have finished its own internal startup process, which includes creating and initializing the `x-ui.db` file.
5.  The script then either failed to find the database file or, more subtly, found an empty or incomplete database file, ran the `UPDATE` command (which does nothing if the rows don't exist yet), and finished, giving the appearance of success.

To fix this, I will add a crucial step: **The script must also wait for the `x-ui.db` file to be created before attempting to modify it.**

I've also added more robust error checking and clearer output messages to make troubleshooting easier if other issues arise.

### Re-checked and Corrected Script

This version ensures that both the certificate from Caddy and the database from 3x-ui are ready before proceeding.
